**Hello Candidate! That's so nice; you've come this far! 🚀**

**Case: Weather App**

**How's it going? 😊 This time, we have a simple task for you. Our company wants you to create a weather app. Here are the details:**

**Basic Features:**

1. Fetch weather information for cities using a free weather API. [Sample API](https://openweathermap.org/current) - You are free to choose whatever you want.
2. Get the city name from the user and nicely display the weather details (temperature, weather condition, wind speed, etc.).
3. Add a cool input box for entering the city and a search button for querying.
4. Show a pleasant loading indicator (loading spinner) when the request is sent.
5. When weather data is successfully retrieved, display this data in an organized way.

**Brief Note**
We've prepared a project template for you, and you can build your project on top of it. This template comes with Ant Design and Styled-Components pre-installed. We expect you to enhance this case using these libraries. P.S.: Thinking it would make your job easier, I've left a few components inside for you.

**Requirements:**

- Make an API request to fetch weather data. (Axios recommended)
- Design a user-friendly and stylish interface, _making it responsive from desktop to mobile screen sizes is big plus_.
- Keep your code organized, add explanatory comments, open a repo on GitHub, and share so we can see what you've done!
